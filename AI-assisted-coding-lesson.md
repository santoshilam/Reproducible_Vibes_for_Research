# AI-assisted Coding with Codeium

This interactive workshop “AI-assisted Coding with Codeium” is designed for researchers who want to optimize their coding workflow using AI-coding assistants tools. Whether you are relatively new to coding or experienced, this course will guide you through practical techniques to improve your coding experience. You will learn how to configure and use AI coding assistants to generate, refactor, and improve code, automate repetitive tasks, and improve documentation. Essential topics such as debugging with AI assistance and managing ethical and security considerations in AI-powered coding environments will also be covered.

By the end of the course, you will have the skills to assess whether you will benefit from using the AI-coding assistant in your coding practice, and if so, then do it with confidence. Basic programming skills and experience with a code editor such as VS Code are necessary. We do not recommend using AI-coding assistants if you're not able to code independently and assess accuracy of the generated output.

This lesson is currently available in the Carpentries Incubator and open to contributions. If you want to learn more, please [visit the lesson in the Carpentries Incubator](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/gen-ai-coding/).

## Lesson structure

1. Introduction to AI-coding assistants

In this episode, participants will learn about AI models behind coding assistants, how they are build and work. This followed by an outline of the popular AI coding assistants and their capabilities. This part is wrapped up with a troubleshooting of any issues during Codeium installation and setup.

2. Code Generation and Optimization

In this episode, participants learn how to use Codeium’s Command, Chat and Autocomplete mode for code generation and refactoring, try out the Chat feature for interactive coding assistance and problem-solving (e.g., bug fixing, code explanation), and optimizing code efficiency. There is a number of exercises to practice these features.

3. Ethical and Security Considerations

In this final episode, participants begin with a scenario-based exercise that is aimed to identify potential challenges and think critically about how participants might address them. After that, we cover a number of ethical and security considerations, finishing up with a set of safety measures and best practices to ensure safe use of AI-coding assistants.
