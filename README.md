# Reproducible_Vibes_for_Research
Repo for TDCC-NES proposal submission on AI Assisted coding and data management

## Introduction
This repository is for collaborting on the TDCC-NES proposal for 2026. The proposal is on the topic of "AI Assisted coding and data management for research", which was developed during the TDCC-NES Collab retreat at Dopersduin in August 2025.

## Problem Statement
The use of AI assited coding has rapidly grown, with the level of assitance varing from asking for code snippets from ChatGPT to attempting to "vibe code" entire applications from scratch without actually writing a line of code. The reserach and education domain are not immune to this and use of this AI tools for programming tasks is quite common. This also means that poor coding practices, coding without knowing what the code actually contains, security risks etc are quite likely. In addition to this the creation of sustainable research software could suffer if poor coding practices are widely adopted. 

While these challenges exist, every crisis is an opportunity and if the wave of AI assisted coding can be guided in the right direction we stand to benefit greatly by way of easier debugging, standardised codew with better documentation and equipping researchers with better know how to produce high quality research software in collaboration with research software engineers.
